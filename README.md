# Sentiment-Analyzer

The growing prevalence of social media platforms has facilitated extensive communication 
among users, generating vast amounts of textual data. Analyzing the sentiment and identifying 
hate speech within these texts holds significant importance for understanding public opinion and 
ensuring a safe online environment. In response, this project presents a web application titled 
"Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Comments."
The application is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, providing 
functionalities such as user registration, authentication, and data storage in an SQLite database. 
Upon registration and login, users gain access to a diverse set of features aimed at analyzing 
sentiment and detecting hate speech in social media comments.
The core functionality of the application lies in its Analyzer page, where users input YouTube 
video links for sentiment analysis using TextBlob and hate speech detection utilizing Logistic 
Regression. The results of these analyses are then visualized using Matplotlib, presenting 
insights through intuitive charts.
Furthermore, the project includes a Dashboard that allows users to track their previous activities 
within the application, providing a comprehensive overview of their interactions and analyses. 
In addition to the Analyzer and Dashboard, the application encompasses essential pages such as 
Home, About, and Contact, ensuring a user-friendly browsing experience.
Overall, "Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Comments" offers a valuable tool for users 
seeking to gain insights into public sentiment and combat hate speech within the realm of social 
media, contributing to a safer and more informed online community.
